# Flask Tasks

The goal is larger than the app itself.
At base, this is an app that allows a user to have a to-do list.
However, the larger idea is more than that, and will (hopefully) encompass some of these points:

- Be able to plug into a SQL or NoSQL database
- Be tested with > 80% coverage
- Have integration with TravisCI/Jenkins
- Have coverage reported to coverage.io
- Deployable to AWS with gunicorn or uwsgi
- Deployable with Docker containers
